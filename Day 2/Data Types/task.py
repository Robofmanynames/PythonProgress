# Subscripting - method of pulling out a particular element from a string

print(len("Hello"))
# prints out how many elements are in Hello
# Using brackets [] use a positive or negative integer to pull an element based on location
# the element always begins with 0. When you use negatives, it starts from the ending and moves toward beginning

# String
print("123" + "345")
# this prints a concatenated answer of 123345, instead of adding the numbers, since you changed it to a string ""
print(123+345)

# Integer = whole number

# Large Integers - we typically use commas. In python, you can replace with underscores
print(12345789)
print(123_456_789)
#same thing prints out ^

# Float - short for floating point number. When you have numbers with decimal places
print(3.14159)

# Boolean - true or false values
print(True)
print(False)
